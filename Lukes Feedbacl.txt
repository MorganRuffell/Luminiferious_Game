Luke's feedback

- You're being a bit premature
- Look at the full game loop
	- Focus on other areas of development
	- If the things arwe fully made.


Coroutines:

	- Try and do the movement smoothly? //Some logic in the update loop, Google this.
	-

Develop my codebase further before I work on anything else.
