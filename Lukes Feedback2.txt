No shadows - HOW????

Toon shaded from two light sources?

convert into vertex shader.

Read the openGL stuff that Luke put in there about lighting models. 

Toon shaders with normals ->

	- think of it in the same context as taking a directional light. 
	- XYZ represents the surface normal relatively. 

	Node that gets to corodinates of normal map. 

How to get it to work with global illumination?

How to get it work with it directional ligjht?

Google it. It's not in the shadow buffer?

Leave the shader, and focus on sorting out the shadows?
Alternatively look into a different shader implementation?
